# Audit Calculator - Development Summary

## Original User Problem Statement
"Update the UI and add a button to the light and dark themes. Not only that apply better to the back end for this project"

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Theme Toggle Implementation
- **ThemeProvider Integration**: Added next-themes provider to root layout with proper configuration
- **Theme Toggle Component**: Created a beautiful toggle component with sun/moon icons that switches between light and dark modes
- **UI Integration**: Added theme toggle button to sidebar header for easy access
- **Theme Persistence**: Themes are saved and restored across sessions using next-themes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Implemented smooth theme switching animations with proper CSS variables

### 2. Backend API Implementation
- **Next.js API Routes**: Created comprehensive REST API endpoints for data management
  - `POST /api/calculations` - Save new calculations
  - `GET /api/calculations` - Retrieve all calculations
  - `GET /api/calculations/[id]` - Get specific calculation
  - `PUT /api/calculations/[id]` - Update calculation
  - `DELETE /api/calculations/[id]` - Delete specific calculation
  - `DELETE /api/calculations` - Clear all calculations
  - `GET /api/stats` - Get calculation statistics
  - `POST /api/export` - Export calculations as CSV

- **File-Based Database**: Implemented JSON file storage in `/data/calculations.json` for persistent data
- **API Client Service**: Created comprehensive API client service for frontend-backend communication
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with fallback to localStorage when API is unavailable

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Features
- **History Management**: Updated to use backend API with loading states and error handling
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time statistics showing total calculations, man-days, unique companies
- **Export Functionality**: Server-side CSV generation with filtering capabilities
- **Refresh Capability**: Added refresh buttons to reload data from backend
- **Improved UX**: Loading states, error messages, and success notifications

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized API calls and state management
- **Scalability**: File-based storage that can easily be migrated to a database
- **Maintainability**: Clean code architecture with separation of concerns
