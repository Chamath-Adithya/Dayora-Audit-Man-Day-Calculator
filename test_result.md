## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIX - SESSION PROVIDER ERROR (January 2025)

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: "React Context is unavailable in Server Components" error during Vercel build
- **Root Cause**: SessionProvider from next-auth/react was being used directly in the Server Component (root layout.tsx)
- **Impact**: Build failure on all pages (/, /admin, /auth/signin, /calculate, /dashboard, /history, /results)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Created Client Component Wrapper**: Created `/components/providers.tsx` with `'use client'` directive
2. **Moved Context Providers**: Moved SessionProvider and ThemeProvider into the client-side wrapper
3. **Updated Root Layout**: Modified `/app/layout.tsx` to use the new Providers component
4. **Environment Setup**: Added proper environment variables (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET)
5. **Database Initialization**: Set up Prisma database and generated client

### Technical Details
- **File Created**: `/components/providers.tsx` - Client-side wrapper for all Context providers
- **File Modified**: `/app/layout.tsx` - Updated to import and use Providers component
- **Environment**: Added `.env.local` with required environment variables
- **Database**: Initialized SQLite database with Prisma schema

### Verification Results ✅
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (`yarn build` completes without errors)
- **All Pages Loading**: ✅ Home, Dashboard, Admin, Calculate, Auth pages functional
- **No Context Errors**: ✅ SessionProvider now properly wrapped in Client Component
- **Authentication System**: ✅ NextAuth integration maintained and functional
- **Theme System**: ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle continues to work
- **Production Ready**: ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

### Files Changed
```
/components/providers.tsx     [CREATED] - Client-side Context wrapper
/app/layout.tsx              [MODIFIED] - Uses new Providers component
/.env.local                  [CREATED] - Environment variables
```

## 🔧 DATABASE CONNECTIVITY FIX - COMPLETED (September 2025)

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Admin and calculation pages were not fetching data from the database
- **Root Cause**: Missing `.env` file, API response format mismatch, React hooks rule violation
- **Impact**: Configuration data not loading, calculation form throwing runtime errors

### Solution Implemented
1. **Environment Configuration**: Created `.env` file with proper DATABASE_URL for Prisma + PostgreSQL Accelerate
2. **Database Setup**: Generated Prisma client, applied schema, seeded with default configuration
3. **API Format Fix**: Updated config API routes to return expected `{ success: true, data: ... }` format
4. **React Hooks Fix**: Resolved hooks rule violation in calculation form component
5. **Database Verification**: Confirmed all Prisma queries and connections working correctly

### Technical Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma Accelerate successfully connected
- **Configuration Data**: Admin config seeded with default standards (QMS, EMS, EnMS, FSMS, Cosmetics)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/config` working correctly with proper response format
- **React Components**: Fixed hooks ordering in `calculation-form-fixed.tsx`

### Verification Results ✅
- **Admin Page**: ✅ Configuration interface fully functional, data loading from database
- **Calculate Page**: ✅ Form loading properly, React hooks error resolved  
- **Database Connectivity**: ✅ All Prisma queries executing successfully
- **Authentication**: ✅ Admin login and role-based access working
- **Configuration Data**: ✅ Employee ranges, standards, categories all populated

### Files Changed
```
/.env                           [CREATED] - Database configuration
/app/api/config/route.ts        [MODIFIED] - Fixed response format
/app/api/config/reset/route.ts  [MODIFIED] - Fixed response format  
/components/calculation-form-fixed.tsx [MODIFIED] - Fixed React hooks issue
```
