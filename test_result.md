## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIX - SESSION PROVIDER ERROR (January 2025)

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: "React Context is unavailable in Server Components" error during Vercel build
- **Root Cause**: SessionProvider from next-auth/react was being used directly in the Server Component (root layout.tsx)
- **Impact**: Build failure on all pages (/, /admin, /auth/signin, /calculate, /dashboard, /history, /results)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Created Client Component Wrapper**: Created `/components/providers.tsx` with `'use client'` directive
2. **Moved Context Providers**: Moved SessionProvider and ThemeProvider into the client-side wrapper
3. **Updated Root Layout**: Modified `/app/layout.tsx` to use the new Providers component
4. **Environment Setup**: Added proper environment variables (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET)
5. **Database Initialization**: Set up Prisma database and generated client

### Technical Details
- **File Created**: `/components/providers.tsx` - Client-side wrapper for all Context providers
- **File Modified**: `/app/layout.tsx` - Updated to import and use Providers component
- **Environment**: Added `.env.local` with required environment variables
- **Database**: Initialized SQLite database with Prisma schema

### Verification Results ✅
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (`yarn build` completes without errors)
- **All Pages Loading**: ✅ Home, Dashboard, Admin, Calculate, Auth pages functional
- **No Context Errors**: ✅ SessionProvider now properly wrapped in Client Component
- **Authentication System**: ✅ NextAuth integration maintained and functional
- **Theme System**: ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle continues to work
- **Production Ready**: ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

### Files Changed
```
/components/providers.tsx     [CREATED] - Client-side Context wrapper
/app/layout.tsx              [MODIFIED] - Uses new Providers component
/.env.local                  [CREATED] - Environment variables
```
